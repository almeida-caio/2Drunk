# 2Drunk
In this repository, you will find some notebooks exploring the exciting features of _2D random walks_, or one may call the _drunkard's walk_, implementing all the related code in Python. Initially, we will be dealing only with a classic version of this stochastic process: a random walk over the two-dimensional square lattice, denoted as ℤ². In that starting scenario, we try to cover some statistical aspects of the said process, before handling with its variations (_e.g._ the Brownian motion) and applications to real world problems.
